# Welcome to the graphql by flask playground

This project intends to implement a task manager application using graphql, sqlalchemy and flask.  
Challenges I am trying to solve are:
* using SQLAlchemy ORM in a professional way(Using alembic for migrations).


# Installation
Setup project environment:
```
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Resources
Here are some good articles and documentations that I found useful:
* [Using migrations for sqlalchemy](https://realpython.com/flask-by-example-part-2-postgres-sqlalchemy-and-alembic/)
